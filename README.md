## 🗂️ Implemented Algorithms

- 🔁 **Bubble Sort** – Simple comparison-based sort with repeated swapping
- 🔢 **Counting Sort** – Non-comparison-based sort for integers within a range
- 🔼 **Heap Sort** – Efficient sort based on binary heap structure
- 🧩 **Insertion Sort** – Builds the sorted array one element at a time
- 🧬 **Merge Sort** – Divide-and-conquer algorithm with guaranteed O(n log n) time
- ⚡ **Quick Sort** – Efficient in-place divide-and-conquer sort
- 📌 **Selection Sort** – Simple and intuitive sort with O(n²) complexity
